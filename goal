I want to build a sample C++ project that demonstrates secure TLS client-server communication using OpenSSL, similar to what a system-level developer at FoundingMinds might work on.

Here is my full project plan:

🎯 Goal

Build a C++ project that demonstrates secure client-server communication using TLS (OpenSSL) — similar to the type of system-level work done at FoundingMinds.

🧩 Phase 1 — Environment Setup

Goal: Prepare C++ build and dependency environment.
Tasks:

Install g++, cmake, make, libssl-dev.

Create folder structure:

cpp-tls-demo/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── src/
├── include/
└── certs/


Initialize Git repository and .gitignore.

⚙️ Phase 2 — Generate Self-Signed Certificates

Goal: Create development certificates for encryption.
Tasks:

Use OpenSSL commands:

openssl genrsa -out certs/server.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key certs/server.key -out certs/server.crt -days 365
openssl req -new -x509 -key certs/server.key -out certs/ca.crt -days 365


Store them inside the certs folder.

💻 Phase 3 — Implement TLS Server

Goal: Create a secure TCP server that:

Loads server certificate and key

Accepts TLS client connections

Reads a message securely

Sends a response securely

Files:
src/tls_server.cpp, include/tls_server.h

Key tasks:

Initialize OpenSSL

Create socket and bind to port 5555

Accept incoming client

Wrap socket with SSL_new and SSL_accept

Exchange messages securely

💻 Phase 4 — Implement TLS Client

Goal: Create a secure client that:

Connects to server via TLS

Sends encrypted message

Receives and decrypts response

Files:
src/tls_client.cpp, include/tls_client.h

Key tasks:

Initialize OpenSSL

Connect to server

Use SSL_connect, SSL_read, SSL_write

🧪 Phase 5 — Build and Run

Goal: Use CMake to compile and run both apps.
Tasks:

Create CMakeLists.txt:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(cpp_tls_demo)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
add_executable(server src/tls_server.cpp)
add_executable(client src/tls_client.cpp)
target_link_libraries(server OpenSSL::SSL OpenSSL::Crypto)
target_link_libraries(client OpenSSL::SSL OpenSSL::Crypto)


Build:

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make


Run:

./server
./client

🚀 Phase 6 — Add Enhancements

Optional Extensions:

Mutual TLS (verify client certificate)

Async server using boost::asio

Multi-threaded connections

Logging using spdlog

Performance testing with valgrind or perf

Turn into mini robot telemetry system (robot sends secure sensor data)

🧠 Deliverables

/src → source files for server & client

/certs → certificate and key

/build → compiled binaries

README.md → project setup + run instructions

Please generate all necessary source files, CMakeLists.txt, and shell scripts to build, run, and test this project locally on Ubuntu. Also explain each phase and include comments in the C++ code for learning purposes.
